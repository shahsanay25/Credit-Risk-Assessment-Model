Credit risk refers to the potential loss that a bank may incur if a borrower fails to repay a loan or credit card debt. Banks face a significant amount of credit risk as they provide loans and credit facilities to individuals and businesses.
PROBLEM DEFINITION:
Credit risk refers to the potential loss that a bank may incur if a borrower fails to repay a loan
or credit card debt. Banks face a significant amount of credit risk as they provide loans and
credit facilities to individuals and businesses.Credit risk analysis is the process of assessing the
likelihood that a borrower will default on their loan or credit card debt, and the potential loss
that may result from such a default. Banks use credit risk analysis to make informed lending
decisions and to manage their credit portfolios.

Effective credit risk analysis helps banks to:
● Identify high-risk borrowers and loans that may be more likely to default
● Set appropriate interest rates and loan terms based on the level of credit risk
● Monitor the credit performance of borrowers and detect early warning signs of potential
defaults
● Mitigate losses by taking appropriate measures to recover unpaid debts or collateral.

In summary, credit risk analysis is crucial for banks to manage their credit risk exposure and
maintain a healthy financial position. The goal of the project is to build a predictive model that
can accurately predict the likelihood of a credit card client defaulting on their payments based
on the given attributes. The model will be trained on a dataset containing historical data of
credit card clients and their default statusThis can be a valuable tool for credit card companies
to assess the risk associated with granting credit to new clients and to make informed decisions
about lending.
